# Contributing

If you're reading these lines, you probably thought about contributing to the work in one of my repositories.

So let me start by saying: :tada:Thank you! Your contributions are very much welcome!:tada:

In the end, this work is open source because I hoped
you might share some of the problems this work is trying to tackle and might want to collaborate in the solution.

## Issues

This is a great way to start contributing to a project.
Your input helps to improve the work and make it more suitable for more users.

Your issues should be clear in their scope and distinct in their content,
so that time is spent on the problem itself and not on figuring out what it might be (or if there is any).

### Bug reports

These are important! If you see the software doing something it should not, don't hesitate to report the behavior.
There might be just a small correction needed to save someone a lot of headache.
Knowing about the problem is the first step to solve it.

> Should you find a bug that poses a security risk:\
> DO NOT share informations about active security risks on any issue board!\
> Please contact me directly or post your contact details,
> so that we get a chance to fix this before it is exploited.

The second step is to reproduce it. So please share any information that helps me and others to isolate the problem.
You should provide a minimal working example of the misbehavior.

Set up an online code example like [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io) if possible.

If you can narrow down, what might cause the problem, it is much appreciated.

### Feature requests

If you happen to have an idea, how the work could be improved, please feel free to share it!

Please try to explain not only what should be changed, but also what it should be used for,
so that others can fully understand your perspective.

Keep in mind that every new feature brings new responsibilities regarding testing and maintenance.
Help assessing the costs and benefits by sharing your story and breaking down what part of the idea is essential to to.

Before you spent too much time on how a new feature could be implemented,
share your initial thought so that we could discuss if that feature should be implemented in the scope of the work.

### Questions

Please be sure to have used [Google](https://google.com) first.

If you have done so and the question is specific to the work in the repository,
there is no shame in using the issue board to ask people familiar with the work.

It might be that the developer didn't see that there is some documentation missing for the intended audience
and others might have the same question.

Just be clear that you lack some information. Don't try to mask questions as bug reports.

If it is a broader question regarding your toolchain, consider asking e.g. on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com).

## Pull requests

If you can provide code that can improve the work, this is the best!\
Pull requests are welcome for every aspect of the work, be it documentation, configuration or programming.

Not every repository strictly enforces coding conventions.
Just try to stick to the conventions already used in the repository and to write code that reflect best practices.

If your contribution breaks compatibility or introduces new features,
you might want to open an issue first to discuss the changes before putting in the work.
